<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>There is a kangaroo at coordinate <var>0</var> on an infinite number line that runs from left to right, at time <var>0</var>.
During the period between time <var>i-1</var> and time <var>i</var>, the kangaroo can either stay at his position, or perform a jump of length exactly <var>i</var> to the left or to the right.
That is, if his coordinate at time <var>i-1</var> is <var>x</var>, he can be at coordinate <var>x-i</var>, <var>x</var> or <var>x+i</var> at time <var>i</var>.
The kangaroo's nest is at coordinate <var>X</var>, and he wants to travel to coordinate <var>X</var> as fast as possible.
Find the earliest possible time to reach coordinate <var>X</var>.</p>
