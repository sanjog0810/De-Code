<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>AtCoder's head office consists of <var>N</var> rooms numbered <var>1</var> to <var>N</var>. For any two rooms, there is a direct passage connecting these rooms.</p>
<p>For security reasons, Takahashi the president asked you to set a <strong>level</strong> for every passage, which is a positive integer and must satisfy the following condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each room <var>i\ (1 \leq i \leq N)</var>, if we leave Room <var>i</var>, pass through some passages whose levels are all equal and get back to Room <var>i</var>, the number of times we pass through a passage is always even.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to set levels to the passages so that the highest level of a passage is minimized.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:</p>
<pre><var>N</var>
</pre>
</section>
</div>
<div class="part">

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print one way to set levels to the passages so that the objective is achieved, as follows:</p>
<pre><var>a_{1,2}</var> <var>a_{1,3}</var> <var>...</var> <var>a_{1,N}</var>
<var>a_{2,3}</var> <var>...</var> <var>a_{2,N}</var>
<var>.</var>
<var>.</var>
<var>.</var>
<var>a_{N-1,N}</var>
</pre>
<p>Here <var>a_{i,j}</var> is the level of the passage connecting Room <var>i</var> and Room <var>j</var>.</p>
<p>If there are multiple solutions, any of them will be accepted.</p>

<p>For example, if we leave Room <var>2</var>, traverse the path <var>2 \to 3 \to 2 \to 3 \to 2 \to 1 \to 2</var> while only passing passages of level <var>1</var> and get back to Room <var>2</var>, we pass through a passage six times.</p></section>
