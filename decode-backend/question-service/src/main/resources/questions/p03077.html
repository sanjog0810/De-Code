<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>In 2028 and after a continuous growth, AtCoder Inc. finally built an empire with six cities (City <var>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</var>)!</p>
<p>There are five means of transport in this empire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Train: travels from City <var>1</var> to <var>2</var> in one minute. A train can occupy at most <var>A</var> people.</li>
<li>Bus: travels from City <var>2</var> to <var>3</var> in one minute. A bus can occupy at most <var>B</var> people.</li>
<li>Taxi: travels from City <var>3</var> to <var>4</var> in one minute. A taxi can occupy at most <var>C</var> people.</li>
<li>Airplane: travels from City <var>4</var> to <var>5</var> in one minute. An airplane can occupy at most <var>D</var> people.</li>
<li>Ship: travels from City <var>5</var> to <var>6</var> in one minute. A ship can occupy at most <var>E</var> people.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of them, one vehicle leaves the city at each integer time (time <var>0</var>, <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, <var>...</var>).</p>
<p>There is a group of <var>N</var> people at City <var>1</var>, and they all want to go to City <var>6</var>.<br/>
At least how long does it take for all of them to reach there? 
You can ignore the time needed to transfer.  </p>

<p>One possible way to travel is as follows.
First, there are <var>N = 5</var> people at City <var>1</var>, as shown in the following image:</p>
<p><img alt=" " src="https://img.atcoder.jp/ghi/9c306138eddc8a2e08acfa5da19bdfe8.png"/></p>
<p>In the first minute, three people travels from City <var>1</var> to City <var>2</var> by train. Note that a train can only occupy at most three people.</p>
<p><img alt=" " src="https://img.atcoder.jp/ghi/bd30b5ab37fc06951c9f5256bb974e4f.png"/></p>
<p>In the second minute, the remaining two people travels from City <var>1</var> to City <var>2</var> by train, and two of the three people who were already at City <var>2</var> travels to City <var>3</var> by bus. Note that a bus can only occupy at most two people.</p>
<p><img alt=" " src="https://img.atcoder.jp/ghi/50f2e49a770a30193fc53588ec8475b3.png"/></p>
<p>In the third minute, two people travels from City <var>2</var> to City <var>3</var> by train, and another two people travels from City <var>3</var> to City <var>4</var> by taxi.</p>
<p><img alt=" " src="https://img.atcoder.jp/ghi/d6d80dc50abe58190905c8c5ea6ba345.png"/></p>
<p>From then on, if they continue traveling without stopping until they reach City <var>6</var>, all of them can reach there in seven minutes.<br/>
There is no way for them to reach City <var>6</var> in <var>6</var> minutes or less.</p>

<p>All kinds of vehicles can occupy <var>N = 10</var> people at a time.
Thus, if they continue traveling without stopping until they reach City <var>6</var>, all of them can reach there in five minutes.  </p>
