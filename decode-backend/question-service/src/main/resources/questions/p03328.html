<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>In some village, there are <var>999</var> towers that are <var>1,(1+2),(1+2+3),...,(1+2+3+...+999)</var> meters high from west to east, at intervals of <var>1</var> meter.</p>
<p>It had been snowing for a while before it finally stopped. For some two adjacent towers located <var>1</var> meter apart, we measured the lengths of the parts of those towers that are not covered with snow, and the results are <var>a</var> meters for the west tower, and <var>b</var> meters for the east tower.</p>
<p>Assuming that the depth of snow cover and the altitude are the same everywhere in the village, find the amount of the snow cover.</p>
<p>Assume also that the depth of the snow cover is always at least <var>1</var> meter.</p>

<p>The heights of the two towers are <var>10</var> meters and <var>15</var> meters, respectively.
Thus, we can see that the depth of the snow cover is <var>2</var> meters.</p>
