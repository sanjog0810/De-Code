<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>There are <var>2N</var> squares arranged from left to right. You are given a string of length <var>2N</var> representing the color of each of the squares.</p>
<p>The color of the <var>i</var>-th square from the left is black if the <var>i</var>-th character of <var>S</var> is <code>B</code>, and white if that character is <code>W</code>.</p>
<p>You will perform the following operation exactly <var>N</var> times: choose two distinct squares, then invert the colors of these squares and the squares between them. Here, to invert the color of a square is to make it white if it is black, and vice versa.  </p>
<p>Throughout this process, you cannot choose the same square twice or more. That is, each square has to be chosen exactly once.</p>
<p>Find the number of ways to make all the squares white at the end of the process, modulo <var>10^9+7</var>.</p>
<p>Two ways to make the squares white are considered different if and only if there exists <var>i</var> <var>(1 \leq i \leq N)</var> such that the pair of the squares chosen in the <var>i</var>-th operation is different.</p>
