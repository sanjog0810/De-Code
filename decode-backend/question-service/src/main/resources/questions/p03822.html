<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p><var>N</var> contestants participated in a competition. The total of <var>N-1</var> matches were played in a knockout tournament.
For some reasons, the tournament may not be "fair" for all the contestants.
That is, the number of the matches that must be played in order to win the championship may be different for each contestant. The structure of the tournament is formally described at the end of this statement.</p>
<p>After each match, there were always one winner and one loser. The last contestant standing was declared the champion.</p>

<p>For convenience, the contestants were numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>. The contestant numbered <var>1</var> was the champion, and the contestant numbered <var>i(2 ≦ i ≦ N)</var> was defeated in a match against the contestant numbered <var>a_i</var>.</p>
<p>We will define the <em>depth</em> of the tournament as the maximum number of the matches that must be played in order to win the championship over all the contestants.</p>
<p>Find the minimum possible depth of the tournament.</p>
<p>The formal description of the structure of the tournament is as follows. In the <var>i</var>-th match, one of the following played against each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two predetermined contestants</li>
<li>One predetermined contestant and the winner of the <var>j</var>-th match, where <var>j(j&lt;i)</var> was predetermined</li>
<li>The winner of the <var>j</var>-th match and the winner of the <var>k</var>-th match, where <var>j</var> and <var>k</var> <var>(j,k&lt;i, j ≠ k)</var> were predetermined</li>
</ul>
<p>Such structure is valid structure of the tournament, if and only if no contestant who has already been defeated in a match will never play in a match, regardless of the outcome of the matches.</p>

<p>The depth of this tournament is <var>3</var>, since contestant <var>5</var> must play three matches in order to win the championship.
There is no tournament with depth <var>2</var> or less that is consistent with the given information, thus the output should be <var>3</var>.</p>
