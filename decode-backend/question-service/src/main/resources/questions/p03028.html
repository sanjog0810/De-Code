<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>We will host a rock-paper-scissors tournament with <var>N</var> people. The participants are called Person <var>1</var>, Person <var>2</var>, <var>\ldots</var>, Person <var>N</var>.
For any two participants, the result of the match between them is determined in advance.
This information is represented by positive integers <var>A_{i,j}</var> ( <var>1 \leq j &lt; i \leq N</var> ) as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <var>A_{i,j} = 0</var>, Person <var>j</var> defeats Person <var>i</var>.</li>
<li>If <var>A_{i,j} = 1</var>, Person <var>i</var> defeats Person <var>j</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tournament proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will arrange the <var>N</var> participants in a row, in the order Person <var>1</var>, Person <var>2</var>, <var>\ldots</var>, Person <var>N</var> from left to right.</li>
<li>We will randomly choose two consecutive persons in the row. They will play a match against each other, and we will remove the loser from the row.
We will repeat this process <var>N-1</var> times, and the last person remaining will be declared the champion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find the number of persons with the possibility of becoming the champion.</p>
