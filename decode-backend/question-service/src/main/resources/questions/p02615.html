<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Quickly after finishing the tutorial of the online game <em>ATChat</em>, you have decided to visit a particular place with <var>N-1</var> players who happen to be there. These <var>N</var> players, including you, are numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>, and the <strong>friendliness</strong> of Player <var>i</var> is <var>A_i</var>.</p>
<p>The <var>N</var> players will arrive at the place one by one in some order. To make sure nobody gets lost, you have set the following rule: players who have already arrived there should form a circle, and a player who has just arrived there should cut into the circle somewhere.</p>
<p>When each player, except the first one to arrive, arrives at the place, the player gets <strong>comfort</strong> equal to the smaller of the friendliness of the clockwise adjacent player and that of the counter-clockwise adjacent player. The first player to arrive there gets the comfort of <var>0</var>.</p>
<p>What is the maximum total comfort the <var>N</var> players can get by optimally choosing the order of arrivals and the positions in the circle to cut into?</p>

<p>By arriving at the place in the order Player <var>4, 2, 1, 3</var>, and cutting into the circle as shown in the figure, they can get the total comfort of <var>7</var>.</p>

<p>They cannot get the total comfort greater than <var>7</var>, so the answer is <var>7</var>.</p>
