<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Ringo Kingdom Congress is voting on a bill.</p>
<p><var>N</var> members are present, and the <var>i</var>-th member <var>(1 ≤ i ≤ N)</var> has <var>w_i</var> white ballots and <var>b_i</var> blue ballots. Each member <var>i</var> will put all the <var>w_i</var> white ballots into the box if he/she is in favor of the bill, and put all the <var>b_i</var> blue ballots into the box if he/she is not in favor of the bill. No other action is allowed. For example, a member must not forfeit voting, or put only a part of his/her white ballots or a part of his/her blue ballots into the box.</p>
<p>After all the members vote, if at least <var>P</var> percent of the ballots in the box is white, the bill is passed; if less than <var>P</var> percent of the ballots is white, the bill is rejected.</p>
<p>In order for the bill to pass, at least how many members must be in favor of it?</p>
