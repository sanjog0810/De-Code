<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Coloring of the vertices of a tree <var>G</var> is called a <em>good coloring</em> when, for every pair of two vertices <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> painted in the same color, picking <var>u</var> as the root and picking <var>v</var> as the root would result in isomorphic rooted trees.</p>
<p>Also, the <em>colorfulness</em> of <var>G</var> is defined as the minimum possible number of different colors used in a good coloring of <var>G</var>.</p>
<p>You are given a tree with <var>N</var> vertices. The vertices are numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>, and the <var>i</var>-th edge connects Vertex <var>a_i</var> and Vertex <var>b_i</var>. We will construct a new tree <var>T</var> by repeating the following operation on this tree some number of times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new vertex to the tree by connecting it to one of the vertices in the current tree with an edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find the minimum possible colorfulness of <var>T</var>.
Additionally, print the minimum number of leaves (vertices with degree <var>1</var>) in a tree <var>T</var> that achieves the minimum colorfulness.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3><p>The phrase "picking <var>u</var> as the root and picking <var>v</var> as the root would result in isomorphic rooted trees" for a tree <var>G</var> means that there exists a bijective function <var>f_{uv}</var> from the vertex set of <var>G</var> to itself such that both of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li><var>f_{uv}(u)=v</var></li>
<li>For every pair of two vertices <var>(a,b)</var>, edge <var>(a,b)</var> exists if and only if edge <var>(f_{uv}(a),f_{uv}(b))</var> exists.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Constraints</h3><ul>

<li>The given graph is a tree.</li>

<h3>Input</h3><p>Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:</p>
<pre><var>N</var>
<var>a_1</var> <var>b_1</var>
<var>:</var>
<var>a_{N-1}</var> <var>b_{N-1}</var>

<h3>Output</h3><p>Print two integers with a space in between.
First, print the minimum possible colorfulness of a tree <var>T</var> that can be constructed.
Second, print the minimum number of leaves in a tree that achieves it.</p>
<p>It can be shown that, under the constraints of this problem, the values that should be printed fit into <var>64</var>-bit signed integers.</p>

<p>If we connect a new vertex <var>6</var> to vertex <var>2</var>, painting the vertices <var>(1,4,5,6)</var> red and painting the vertices <var>(2,3)</var> blue is a good coloring.
Since painting all the vertices in a single color is not a good coloring, we can see that the colorfulness of this tree is <var>2</var>.
This is actually the optimal solution. There are four leaves, so we should print <var>2</var> and <var>4</var>.</p>
