<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>On some day in January <var>2018</var>, Takaki is writing a document. The document has a column where the current date is written in <code>yyyy/mm/dd</code> format. For example, January <var>23</var>, <var>2018</var> should be written as <code>2018/01/23</code>.</p>
<p>After finishing the document, she noticed that she had mistakenly wrote <code>2017</code> at the beginning of the date column. Write a program that, when the string that Takaki wrote in the date column, <var>S</var>, is given as input, modifies the first four characters in <var>S</var> to <code>2018</code> and prints it.</p>
