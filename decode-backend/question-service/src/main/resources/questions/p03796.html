<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke loves working out. He is now exercising <var>N</var> times.</p>
<p>Before he starts exercising, his <em>power</em> is <var>1</var>. After he exercises for the <var>i</var>-th time, his power gets multiplied by <var>i</var>.</p>
<p>Find Snuke's power after he exercises <var>N</var> times. Since the answer can be extremely large, print the answer modulo <var>10^{9}+7</var>.</p>
