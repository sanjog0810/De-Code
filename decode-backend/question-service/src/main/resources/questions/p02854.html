<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Takahashi, who works at DISCO, is standing before an iron bar.
The bar has <var>N-1</var> notches, which divide the bar into <var>N</var> sections. The <var>i</var>-th section from the left has a length of <var>A_i</var> millimeters.</p>
<p>Takahashi wanted to choose a notch and cut the bar at that point into two parts with the same length.
However, this may not be possible as is, so he will do the following operations some number of times <strong>before</strong> he does the cut:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose one section and expand it, increasing its length by <var>1</var> millimeter. Doing this operation once costs <var>1</var> yen (the currency of Japan).</li>
<li>Choose one section of length at least <var>2</var> millimeters and shrink it, decreasing its length by <var>1</var> millimeter. Doing this operation once costs <var>1</var> yen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find the minimum amount of money needed before cutting the bar into two parts with the same length.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>3

<p>The initial lengths of the sections are <var>[2, 4, 3]</var> (in millimeters). Takahashi can cut the bar equally after doing the following operations for <var>3</var> yen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shrink the second section from the left. The lengths of the sections are now <var>[2, 3, 3]</var>.</li>
<li>Shrink the first section from the left. The lengths of the sections are now <var>[1, 3, 3]</var>.</li>
<li>Shrink the second section from the left. The lengths of the sections are now <var>[1, 2, 3]</var>, and we can cut the bar at the second notch from the left into two parts of length <var>3</var> each.</li>
