<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi participated in a contest on AtCoder.</p>
<p>The contest had <var>N</var> problems.</p>
<p>Takahashi made <var>M</var> submissions during the contest.</p>
<p>The <var>i</var>-th submission was made for the <var>p_i</var>-th problem and received the verdict <var>S_i</var> (<code>AC</code> or <code>WA</code>).</p>
<p>The number of Takahashi's correct answers is the number of problems on which he received an <code>AC</code> once or more.</p>
<p>The number of Takahashi's penalties is the sum of the following count for the problems on which he received an <code>AC</code> once or more: the number of <code>WA</code>s received before receiving an <code>AC</code> for the first time on that problem.</p>
<p>Find the numbers of Takahashi's correct answers and penalties.</p>

<p>In his second submission, he received an <code>AC</code> on the first problem for the first time. Before this, he received one <code>WA</code> on this problem.</p>
<p>In his fourth submission, he received an <code>AC</code> on the second problem for the first time. Before this, he received one <code>WA</code> on this problem.</p>
<p>Thus, he has two correct answers and two penalties.</p>
