<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p><var>N</var> cells are arranged in a row.
Some of them may contain tokens.
You are given a string <var>s</var> that consists of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s.
If the <var>i</var>-th character of <var>s</var> is <code>1</code>, the <var>i</var>-th cell (from left) contains a token.
Otherwise, it doesn't contain a token.</p>
<p>Snuke wants to perform the following operation as many times as possible.
In each operation, he chooses three consecutive cells.
Let's call the cells <var>X, Y, Z</var> from left to right.
In order for the operation to be valid, both <var>X</var> and <var>Z</var> must contain tokens and <var>Y</var> must not contain a token.
Then, he removes these two tokens and puts a new token on <var>Y</var>.</p>
<p>How many operations can he perform if he performs operations in the optimal way?</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3><ul>
<li><var>1 \leq N \leq 500,000</var></li>
<li><var>|s| = N</var></li>
<li>Each character in <var>s</var> is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>

<p>For example, he can perform two operations in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform an operation on the last three cells. Now the string that represents tokens becomes <code>1010010</code>.</li>
<li>Perform an operation on the first three cells. Now the string that represents tokens becomes <code>0100010</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the choice of operations matters.
For example, if he chooses three cells in the middle first, he can perform no more operations.</p>
