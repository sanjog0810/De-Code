<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>The currency used in Takahashi Kingdom is <em>Myon</em>.
There are <var>1</var>-, <var>10</var>-, <var>100</var>-, <var>1000</var>- and <var>10000</var>-Myon coins, and so forth. Formally, there are <var>10^n</var>-Myon coins for any non-negative integer <var>n</var>.</p>
<p>There are <var>N</var> items being sold at Ex Store.
The price of the <var>i</var>-th <var>(1≦i≦N)</var> item is <var>A_i</var> Myon.</p>
<p>Takahashi is going to buy some, at least one, possibly all, of these <var>N</var> items.
He hates receiving change, so he wants to bring coins to the store so that he can pay the total price without receiving change, no matter what items he chooses to buy.
Also, since coins are heavy, he wants to bring as few coins as possible.</p>
<p>Find the minimum number of coins he must bring to the store. It can be assumed that he has an infinite supply of coins.</p>
