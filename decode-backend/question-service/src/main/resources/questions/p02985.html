<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>You are given a tree with <var>N</var> vertices and <var>N-1</var> edges. The vertices are numbered <var>1</var> to <var>N</var>, and the <var>i</var>-th edge connects Vertex <var>a_i</var> and <var>b_i</var>.</p>
<p>You have coloring materials of <var>K</var> colors.
For each vertex in the tree, you will choose one of the <var>K</var> colors to paint it, so that the following condition is satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the distance between two different vertices <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> is less than or equal to two, <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> have different colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many ways are there to paint the tree? Find the count modulo <var>1\ 000\ 000\ 007</var>.</p>
