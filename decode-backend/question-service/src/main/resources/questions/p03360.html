<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>There are three positive integers <var>A</var>, <var>B</var> and <var>C</var> written on a blackboard. E869120 performs the following operation <var>K</var> times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose one integer written on the blackboard and let the chosen integer be <var>n</var>. Replace the chosen integer with <var>2n</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the largest possible sum of the integers written on the blackboard after <var>K</var> operations?</p>
</section>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><var>A, B</var> and <var>C</var> are integers between <var>1</var> and <var>50</var> (inclusive).</li>
<li><var>K</var> is an integer between <var>1</var> and <var>10</var> (inclusive).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:</p>
<pre><var>A</var> <var>B</var> <var>C</var>
<var>K</var>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print the largest possible sum of the integers written on the blackboard after <var>K</var> operations by E869220.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>30
</pre>
<p>In this sample, <var>5, 3, 11</var> are initially written on the blackboard, and E869120 can perform the operation once.<br/>
There are three choices:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Double <var>5</var>: The integers written on the board after the operation are <var>10, 3, 11</var>.</li>
<li>Double <var>3</var>: The integers written on the board after the operation are <var>5, 6, 11</var>.</li>
<li>Double <var>11</var>: The integers written on the board after the operation are <var>5, 3, 22</var>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If he chooses 3., the sum of the integers written on the board afterwards is <var>5 + 3 + 22 = 30</var>, which is the largest among 1. through 3.  </p>

<h3>Sample Output 2</h3><pre>22
</pre>
<p>E869120 can perform the operation twice. The sum of the integers eventually written on the blackboard is maximized as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li>First, double <var>4</var>. The integers written on the board are now <var>3, 3, 8</var>.  </li>
<li>Next, double <var>8</var>. The integers written on the board are now <var>3, 3, 16</var>.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the sum of the integers eventually written on the blackboard is <var>3 + 3 + 16 = 22</var>.</p></section>
