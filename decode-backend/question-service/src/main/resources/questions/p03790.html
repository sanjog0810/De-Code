<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>There is a railroad in Takahashi Kingdom.
The railroad consists of <var>N</var> sections, numbered <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, ..., <var>N</var>, and <var>N+1</var> stations, numbered <var>0</var>, <var>1</var>, ..., <var>N</var>. Section <var>i</var> directly connects the stations <var>i-1</var> and <var>i</var>.
A train takes exactly <var>A_i</var> minutes to run through section <var>i</var>, regardless of direction.
Each of the <var>N</var> sections is either single-tracked over the whole length, or double-tracked over the whole length.
If <var>B_i = 1</var>, section <var>i</var> is single-tracked; if <var>B_i = 2</var>, section <var>i</var> is double-tracked.
Two trains running in opposite directions can cross each other on a double-tracked section, but not on a single-tracked section.
Trains can also cross each other at a station.</p>
<p>Snuke is creating the timetable for this railroad. In this timetable, the trains on the railroad run every <var>K</var> minutes, as shown in the following figure. Here, bold lines represent the positions of trains running on the railroad. (See Sample 1 for clarification.)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://atcoder.jp/img/agc011/a5c221ce77ab6ee8aee48e75a4e5c969.png"/></p>
<p>When creating such a timetable, find the minimum sum of the amount of time required for a train to depart station <var>0</var> and reach station <var>N</var>, and the amount of time required for a train to depart station <var>N</var> and reach station <var>0</var>.
It can be proved that, if there exists a timetable satisfying the conditions in this problem, this minimum sum is always an integer.</p>
<p>Formally, the times at which trains arrive and depart must satisfy the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each train either departs station <var>0</var> and is bound for station <var>N</var>, or departs station <var>N</var> and is bound for station <var>0</var>.</li>
<li>Each train takes exactly <var>A_i</var> minutes to run through section <var>i</var>. For example, if a train bound for station <var>N</var> departs station <var>i-1</var> at time <var>t</var>, the train arrives at station <var>i</var> exactly at time <var>t+A_i</var>.</li>
<li>Assume that a train bound for station <var>N</var> arrives at a station at time <var>s</var>, and departs the station at time <var>t</var>. Then, the next train bound for station <var>N</var> arrives at the station at time <var>s+K</var>, and departs the station at time <var>t+K</var>. Additionally, the previous train bound for station <var>N</var> arrives at the station at time <var>s-K</var>, and departs the station at time <var>t-K</var>. This must also be true for trains bound for station <var>0</var>.</li>
<li>Trains running in opposite directions must not be running on the same single-tracked section (except the stations at both ends) at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partial Score</h3><ul>
<li>In the test set worth <var>500</var> points, all the sections are single-tracked. That is, <var>B_i = 1</var>.</li>
<li>In the test set worth another <var>500</var> points, <var>N \leq 200</var>.</li>

<h3>Output</h3><p>Print an integer representing the minimum sum of the amount of time required for a train to depart station <var>0</var> and reach station <var>N</var>, and the amount of time required for a train to depart station <var>N</var> and reach station <var>0</var>.
