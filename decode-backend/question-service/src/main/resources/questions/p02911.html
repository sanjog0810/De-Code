<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Takahashi has decided to hold fastest-finger-fast quiz games. Kizahashi, who is in charge of making the scoreboard, is struggling to write the program that manages the players' scores in a game, which proceeds as follows.</p>
<p>A game is played by <var>N</var> players, numbered <var>1</var> to <var>N</var>. At the beginning of a game, each player has <var>K</var> points.</p>
<p>When a player correctly answers a question, each of the other <var>N-1</var> players receives minus one (<var>-1</var>) point. There is no other factor that affects the players' scores.</p>
<p>At the end of a game, the players with <var>0</var> points or lower are eliminated, and the remaining players survive.</p>
<p>In the last game, the players gave a total of <var>Q</var> correct answers, the <var>i</var>-th of which was given by Player <var>A_i</var>.
For Kizahashi, write a program that determines whether each of the <var>N</var> players survived this game.</p>
