<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>AtCoDeer the deer and his friend TopCoDeer is playing a game.
The game consists of <var>N</var> turns.
In each turn, each player plays one of the two <em>gestures</em>, <em>Rock</em> and <em>Paper</em>, as in Rock-paper-scissors, under the following condition:</p>
<p>(※) After each turn, (the number of times the player has played Paper)<var>≦</var>(the number of times the player has played Rock).</p>
<p>Each player's score is calculated by (the number of turns where the player wins) <var>-</var> (the number of turns where the player loses), where the outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of Rock-paper-scissors.</p>
<p><em>(For those who are not familiar with Rock-paper-scissors: If one player plays Rock and the other plays Paper, the latter player will win and the former player will lose. If both players play the same gesture, the round is a tie and neither player will win nor lose.)</em></p>
<p>With his supernatural power, AtCoDeer was able to foresee the gesture that TopCoDeer will play in each of the <var>N</var> turns, before the game starts.
Plan AtCoDeer's gesture in each turn to maximize AtCoDeer's score.</p>
<p>The gesture that TopCoDeer will play in each turn is given by a string <var>s</var>. If the <var>i</var>-th <var>(1≦i≦N)</var> character in <var>s</var> is <code>g</code>, TopCoDeer will play Rock in the <var>i</var>-th turn. Similarly, if the <var>i</var>-th <var>(1≦i≦N)</var> character of <var>s</var> in <code>p</code>, TopCoDeer will play Paper in the <var>i</var>-th turn.</p>
