<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>An adult game master and <var>N</var> children are playing a game on an ice rink.
The game consists of <var>K</var> rounds.
In the <var>i</var>-th round, the game master announces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form groups consisting of <var>A_i</var> children each!</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the children who are still in the game form as many groups of <var>A_i</var> children as possible.
One child may belong to at most one group.
Those who are left without a group leave the game. The others proceed to the next round.
Note that it's possible that nobody leaves the game in some round.</p>
<p>In the end, after the <var>K</var>-th round, there are exactly two children left, and they are declared the winners.</p>
<p>You have heard the values of <var>A_1</var>, <var>A_2</var>, ..., <var>A_K</var>. You don't know <var>N</var>, but you want to estimate it.</p>
<p>Find the smallest and the largest possible number of children in the game before the start, or determine that no valid values of <var>N</var> exist.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3><ul>
<li><var>1 \leq K \leq 10^5</var></li>
<li><var>2 \leq A_i \leq 10^9</var></li>
<li>All input values are integers.</li>

<h3>Input</h3><p>Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:</p>

<h3>Output</h3><p>Print two integers representing the smallest and the largest possible value of <var>N</var>, respectively,
or a single integer <var>-1</var> if the described situation is impossible.</p>

<p>For example, if the game starts with <var>6</var> children, then it proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first round, <var>6</var> children form <var>2</var> groups of <var>3</var> children, and nobody leaves the game.</li>
<li>In the second round, <var>6</var> children form <var>1</var> group of <var>4</var> children, and <var>2</var> children leave the game.</li>
<li>In the third round, <var>4</var> children form <var>1</var> group of <var>3</var> children, and <var>1</var> child leaves the game.</li>
<li>In the fourth round, <var>3</var> children form <var>1</var> group of <var>2</var> children, and <var>1</var> child leaves the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last <var>2</var> children are declared the winners.</p>
