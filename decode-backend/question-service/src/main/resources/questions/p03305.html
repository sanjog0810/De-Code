<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Kenkoooo is planning a trip in Republic of Snuke.
In this country, there are <var>n</var> cities and <var>m</var> trains running.
The cities are numbered <var>1</var> through <var>n</var>, and the <var>i</var>-th train connects City <var>u_i</var> and <var>v_i</var> bidirectionally.
Any city can be reached from any city by changing trains.</p>
<p>Two currencies are used in the country: yen and snuuk.
Any train fare can be paid by both yen and snuuk.
The fare of the <var>i</var>-th train is <var>a_i</var> yen if paid in yen, and <var>b_i</var> snuuk if paid in snuuk.</p>
<p>In a city with a money exchange office, you can change <var>1</var> yen into <var>1</var> snuuk.
However, when you do a money exchange, you have to change all your yen into snuuk.
That is, if Kenkoooo does a money exchange when he has <var>X</var> yen, he will then have <var>X</var> snuuk.
Currently, there is a money exchange office in every city, but the office in City <var>i</var> will shut down in <var>i</var> years and can never be used in and after that year.</p>
<p>Kenkoooo is planning to depart City <var>s</var> with <var>10^{15}</var> yen in his pocket and head for City <var>t</var>, and change his yen into snuuk in some city while traveling.
It is acceptable to do the exchange in City <var>s</var> or City <var>t</var>.</p>
<p>Kenkoooo would like to have as much snuuk as possible when he reaches City <var>t</var> by making the optimal choices for the route to travel and the city to do the exchange.
For each <var>i=0,...,n-1</var>, find the maximum amount of snuuk that Kenkoooo has when he reaches City <var>t</var> if he goes on a trip from City <var>s</var> to City <var>t</var> after <var>i</var> years.
You can assume that the trip finishes within the year.</p>

In the <var>i</var>-th line, print the maximum amount of snuuk that Kenkoooo has when he reaches City <var>t</var> if he goes on a trip from City <var>s</var> to City <var>t</var> after <var>i-1</var> years.</p>

<p>After <var>0</var> years, it is optimal to do the exchange in City <var>1</var>.<br/>
After <var>1</var> years, it is optimal to do the exchange in City <var>2</var>.<br/>
Note that City <var>1</var> can still be visited even after the exchange office is closed.
Also note that, if it was allowed to keep <var>1</var> yen when do the exchange in City <var>2</var> and change the remaining yen into snuuk, we could reach City <var>3</var> with <var>999999999999998</var> snuuk, but this is NOT allowed.<br/>
After <var>2</var> years, it is optimal to do the exchange in City <var>3</var>.<br/>
After <var>3</var> years, it is optimal to do the exchange in City <var>4</var>.
Note that the same train can be used multiple times.</p>
