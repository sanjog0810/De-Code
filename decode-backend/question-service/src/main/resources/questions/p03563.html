<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi is a user of a site that hosts programming contests.<br/>
When a user competes in a contest, the <em>rating</em> of the user (not necessarily an integer) changes according to the <em>performance</em> of the user, as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Let the current rating of the user be <var>a</var>.</li>
<li>Suppose that the performance of the user in the contest is <var>b</var>.</li>
<li>Then, the new rating of the user will be the avarage of <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if a user with rating <var>1</var> competes in a contest and gives performance <var>1000</var>, his/her new rating will be <var>500.5</var>, the average of <var>1</var> and <var>1000</var>.</p>
<p>Takahashi's current rating is <var>R</var>, and he wants his rating to be exactly <var>G</var> after the next contest.<br/>
Find the performance required to achieve it.  </p>

<p>Takahashi's current rating is <var>2002</var>.<br/>
If his performance in the contest is <var>2032</var>, his rating will be the average of <var>2002</var> and <var>2032</var>, which is equal to the desired rating, <var>2017</var>.</p>
