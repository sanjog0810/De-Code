<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke has <var>X+Y</var> balls.
<var>X</var> of them have an integer <var>A</var> written on them, and the other <var>Y</var> of them have an integer <var>B</var> written on them.</p>
<p>Snuke will divide these balls into some number of groups.
Here, every ball should be contained in exactly one group, and every group should contain one or more balls.</p>
<p>A group is said to be <strong>good</strong> when the sum of the integers written on the balls in that group is a multiple of an integer <var>C</var>.
Find the maximum possible number of good groups.</p>
<p>Solve <var>T</var> test cases for each input file.</p>

<h3>Input</h3><p>Input is given from Standard Input in the following format.
The first line is as follows:</p>
<pre><var>T</var>

<p>Then, <var>T</var> test cases follow.
Each test case is given in the following format:</p>

<p>In the first test case, we can have two good groups by making the following groups: <var>\{3,3,4\}</var> and <var>\{3,4,4,4\}</var>.</p>
<p>In the second test case, we can have two good groups by making the following groups: <var>\{2,1\}, \{1,1,1\},</var> and <var>\{1\}</var>.</p></section>
