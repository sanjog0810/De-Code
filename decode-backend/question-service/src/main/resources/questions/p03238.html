<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>In <var>2020</var>, AtCoder Inc. with an annual sales of more than one billion yen (the currency of Japan) has started a business in programming education.<br/>
One day, there was an exam where a one-year-old child must write a program that prints <code>Hello World</code>, and a two-year-old child must write a program that receives integers <var>A, B</var> and prints <var>A+B</var>.<br/>
Takahashi, who is taking this exam, suddenly forgets his age.<br/>
He decides to write a program that first receives his age <var>N</var> (<var>1</var> or <var>2</var>) as input, then prints <code>Hello World</code> if <var>N=1</var>, and additionally receives integers <var>A, B</var> and prints <var>A+B</var> if <var>N=2</var>.<br/>
Write this program for him.  </p>
