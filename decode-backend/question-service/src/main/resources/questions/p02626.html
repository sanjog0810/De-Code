<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>There are <var>N</var> piles of stones. The <var>i</var>-th pile has <var>A_i</var> stones.</p>
<p>Aoki and Takahashi are about to use them to play the following game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting with Aoki, the two players alternately do the following operation:<ul>
<li>Operation: Choose one pile of stones, and remove one or more stones from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a player is unable to do the operation, he loses, and the other player wins.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the two players play optimally, there are two possibilities in this game: the player who moves first always wins, or the player who moves second always wins, only depending on the initial number of stones in each pile.</p>
<p>In such a situation, Takahashi, the second player to act, is trying to guarantee his win by moving at least zero and at most <var>(A_1 - 1)</var> stones from the <var>1</var>-st pile to the <var>2</var>-nd pile before the game begins.</p>
<p>If this is possible, print the minimum number of stones to move to guarantee his victory; otherwise, print <code>-1</code> instead.</p>

<p>Without moving stones, if Aoki first removes <var>2</var> stones from the <var>1</var>-st pile, Takahashi cannot win in any way.</p>
<p>If Takahashi moves <var>1</var> stone from the <var>1</var>-st pile to the <var>2</var>-nd before the game begins so that both piles have <var>4</var> stones, Takahashi can always win by properly choosing his actions.</p>
