<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
          You are going to take the entrance examination of Kyoto University tomorrow 
          and have decided to memorize a set of strings <var>S</var> that is expected to appear in the examination. 
          Since it is really tough to memorize <var>S</var> as it is, 
          you have decided to memorize a single string <var>T</var> that efficiently contains all the strings in <var>S</var>.
        </p>
        You have already confirmed the following conditions for <var>S</var> and <var>T</var> are satisfied.
        <ul>
<li>Every string in <var>S</var> is a <strong>consecutive</strong> subsequence<sup>(1)</sup> in <var>T</var> . </li>
<li>For every pair of strings <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> <var>(x \neq y)</var> in <var>S</var> , 
            <var>x</var> is not a subsequence<sup>(2)</sup> of <var>y</var>. </li>
</ul>
<p> Note that (1) is ''consecutive subsequence'', while (2) is ''subsequence''. </p>
<p>
          The next day, you opened the problem booklet at the examination 
          and found that you can get a full score only if you remember <var>S</var>. 
          However, You have forgot how to reconstruct <var>S</var> from <var>T</var> .
          Since all you remember is that <var>T</var> satisfies the above conditions, 
          first you have decided to find the maximum possible number of elements in <var>S</var> .

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><var>1 \leq |T| \leq 10^5</var></li>
<li><var>T</var> consists of only lowercase letters. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Partial points</h3>
<ul>
<li><var>30</var> points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying the condition: <var>1 \leq |T| \leq 50</var> .</li>
<li>Another <var>30</var> points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying the condition: <var>1 \leq |T| \leq 10^3</var>. </li>
