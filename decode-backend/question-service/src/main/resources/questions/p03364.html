<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke has two boards, each divided into a grid with <var>N</var> rows and <var>N</var> columns.
For both of these boards, the square at the <var>i</var>-th row from the top and the <var>j</var>-th column from the left is called Square <var>(i,j)</var>.</p>
<p>There is a lowercase English letter written in each square on the first board. The letter written in Square <var>(i,j)</var> is <var>S_{i,j}</var>. On the second board, nothing is written yet.</p>
<p>Snuke will write letters on the second board, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, choose two integers <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> ( <var>0 \leq A, B &lt; N</var> ).</li>
<li>Write one letter in each square on the second board.
Specifically, write the letter written in Square <var>( i+A, j+B )</var> on the first board into Square <var>(i,j)</var> on the second board.
Here, the <var>k</var>-th row is also represented as the <var>(N+k)</var>-th row, and the <var>k</var>-th column is also represented as the <var>(N+k)</var>-th column.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this operation, the second board is called a <em>good</em> board when, for every <var>i</var> and <var>j</var> ( <var>1 \leq i, j \leq N</var> ), the letter in Square <var>(i,j)</var> and the letter in Square <var>(j,i)</var> are equal.</p>
<p>Find the number of the ways to choose integers <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> ( <var>0 \leq A, B &lt; N</var> ) such that the second board is a good board.</p>

<p>For each pair of <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, the second board will look as shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://img.atcoder.jp/agc023/2414e26dc3abb6dd7bfa0c800bb4af0c.png"/></p>
<p>The second board is a good board when <var>(A,B) = (0,1)</var> or <var>(A,B) = (1,0)</var>, thus the answer is <var>2</var>.</p>
