<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi is a member of a programming competition site, <em>ButCoder</em>.</p>
<p>Each member of ButCoder is assigned two values: <strong>Inner Rating</strong> and <strong>Displayed Rating</strong>.</p>
<p>The Displayed Rating of a member is equal to their Inner Rating if the member has participated in <var>10</var> or more contests. Otherwise, the Displayed Rating will be their Inner Rating minus <var>100 \times (10 - K)</var> when the member has participated in <var>K</var> contests.</p>
<p>Takahashi has participated in <var>N</var> contests, and his Displayed Rating is <var>R</var>. Find his Inner Rating.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>3719

<p>Takahashi has participated in <var>2</var> contests, which is less than <var>10</var>, so his Displayed Rating is his Inner Rating minus <var>100 \times (10 - 2) = 800</var>.</p>
<p>Thus, Takahashi's Inner Rating is <var>2919 + 800 = 3719</var>.</p>
