<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi is practicing <em>shiritori</em> alone again today.</p>
<p>Shiritori is a game as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first turn, a player announces any one word.</li>
<li>In the subsequent turns, a player announces a word that satisfies the following conditions:<ul>
<li>That word is not announced before.</li>
<li>The first character of that word is the same as the last character of the last word announced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this game, he is practicing to announce as many words as possible in ten seconds.</p>
<p>You are given the number of words Takahashi announced, <var>N</var>, and the <var>i</var>-th word he announced, <var>W_i</var>, for each <var>i</var>. Determine if the rules of shiritori was observed, that is, every word announced by him satisfied the conditions.</p>
