<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi and Aoki will play a game with a number line and some segments.
Takahashi is standing on the number line and he is initially at coordinate <var>0</var>.
Aoki has <var>N</var> segments. The <var>i</var>-th segment is <var>[L_i,R_i]</var>, that is, a segment consisting of points with coordinates between <var>L_i</var> and <var>R_i</var> (inclusive).</p>
<p>The game has <var>N</var> steps. The <var>i</var>-th step proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, Aoki chooses a segment that is still not chosen yet from the <var>N</var> segments and tells it to Takahashi.</li>
<li>Then, Takahashi walks along the number line to some point within the segment chosen by Aoki this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>After <var>N</var> steps are performed, Takahashi will return to coordinate <var>0</var> and the game ends.</p>
<p>Let <var>K</var> be the total distance traveled by Takahashi throughout the game. Aoki will choose segments so that <var>K</var> will be as large as possible, and Takahashi walks along the line so that <var>K</var> will be as small as possible. What will be the value of <var>K</var> in the end?</p>

<h3>Output</h3><p>Print the total distance traveled by Takahashi throughout the game when Takahashi and Aoki acts as above.
It is guaranteed that <var>K</var> is always an integer when <var>L_i,R_i</var> are integers.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>10
</pre>
<p>One possible sequence of actions of Takahashi and Aoki is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aoki chooses the first segment. Takahashi moves from coordinate <var>0</var> to <var>-4</var>, covering a distance of <var>4</var>.</li>
<li>Aoki chooses the third segment. Takahashi stays at coordinate <var>-4</var>.</li>
<li>Aoki chooses the second segment. Takahashi moves from coordinate <var>-4</var> to <var>3</var>, covering a distance of <var>7</var>.</li>
<li>Takahashi moves from coordinate <var>3</var> to <var>0</var>, covering a distance of <var>3</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distance covered by Takahashi here is <var>14</var> (because Takahashi didn't move optimally).
It turns out that if both players move optimally, the distance covered by Takahashi will be <var>10</var>.</p>
