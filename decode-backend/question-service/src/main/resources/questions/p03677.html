<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke is buying a lamp.
The light of the lamp can be adjusted to <var>m</var> levels of brightness, represented by integers from <var>1</var> through <var>m</var>, by the two buttons on the remote control.</p>
<p>The first button is a "forward" button. When this button is pressed, the brightness level is increased by <var>1</var>, except when the brightness level is <var>m</var>, in which case the brightness level becomes <var>1</var>.</p>
<p>The second button is a "favorite" button. When this button is pressed, the brightness level becomes the favorite brightness level <var>x</var>, which is set when the lamp is purchased.</p>
<p>Snuke is thinking of setting the favorite brightness level <var>x</var> so that he can efficiently adjust the brightness.
He is planning to change the brightness <var>n-1</var> times. In the <var>i</var>-th change, the brightness level is changed from <var>a_i</var> to <var>a_{i+1}</var>. The initial brightness level is <var>a_1</var>.
Find the number of times Snuke needs to press the buttons when <var>x</var> is set to minimize this number.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>5

<p>When the favorite brightness level is set to <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, <var>3</var>, <var>4</var>, <var>5</var> and <var>6</var>, Snuke needs to press the buttons <var>8</var>, <var>9</var>, <var>7</var>, <var>5</var>, <var>6</var> and <var>9</var> times, respectively.
Thus, Snuke should set the favorite brightness level to <var>4</var>.
In this case, the brightness is adjusted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first change, press the favorite button once, then press the forward button once.</li>
<li>In the second change, press the forward button twice.</li>
<li>In the third change, press the favorite button once.</li>
</ul>
