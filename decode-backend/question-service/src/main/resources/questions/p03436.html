<h3>Problem statement</h3>
<p>We have an <var>H \times W</var> grid whose squares are painted black or white. The square at the <var>i</var>-th row from the top and the <var>j</var>-th column from the left is denoted as <var>(i, j)</var>.<br/>
Snuke would like to play the following game on this grid. At the beginning of the game, there is a character called Kenus at square <var>(1, 1)</var>. The player repeatedly moves Kenus up, down, left or right by one square. The game is completed when Kenus reaches square <var>(H, W)</var> passing only white squares.<br/>
Before Snuke starts the game, he can change the color of some of the white squares to black. However, he cannot change the color of square <var>(1, 1)</var> and <var>(H, W)</var>. Also, changes of color must all be carried out before the beginning of the game.<br/>
When the game is completed, Snuke's score will be the number of times he changed the color of a square before the beginning of the game. Find the maximum possible score that Snuke can achieve, or print <var>-1</var> if the game cannot be completed, that is, Kenus can never reach square <var>(H, W)</var> regardless of how Snuke changes the color of the squares.  </p>
<p>The color of the squares are given to you as characters <var>s_{i, j}</var>. If square <var>(i, j)</var> is initially painted by white, <var>s_{i, j}</var> is <code>.</code>; if square <var>(i, j)</var> is initially painted by black, <var>s_{i, j}</var> is <code>#</code>.</p>
