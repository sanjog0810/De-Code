<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke participated in a magic show.</p>
<p>A magician prepared <var>N</var> identical-looking boxes.
He put a treasure in one of the boxes, closed the boxes, shuffled them, and numbered them <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>.</p>
<p>Since the boxes are shuffled, now Snuke has no idea which box contains the treasure.
Snuke wins the game if he opens a box containing the treasure.
You may think that if Snuke opens all boxes at once, he can always win the game.
However, there are some tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snuke must open the boxes one by one. After he opens a box and checks the content of the box, he must close the box before opening the next box.</li>
<li>He is only allowed to open Box <var>i</var> at most <var>a_i</var> times.</li>
<li>The magician may secretly move the treasure from a closed box to another closed box, using some magic trick.
For simplicity, assume that the magician never moves the treasure while Snuke is opening some box.
However, he can move it at any other time (before Snuke opens the first box, or between he closes some box and opens the next box).</li>
<li>The magician can perform the magic trick at most <var>K</var> times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can Snuke always win the game, regardless of the initial position of the treasure and the movements of the magician?</p>

<h3>Input</h3><p>Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:</p>
<pre><var>N</var> <var>K</var>

<h3>Output</h3><p>If the answer is no, print a single <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, print one possible move of Snuke in the following format:</p>
<pre><var>Q</var>
<var>x_1</var> <var>x_2</var> <var>\cdots</var> <var>x_Q</var>
</pre>
<p>It means that he opens boxes <var>x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_Q</var> in this order.</p>
<p>In case there are multiple possible solutions, you can output any.</p>

<p>If Snuke opens the boxes <var>7</var> times in the order <var>1 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1</var>, he can always find the treasure regardless of its initial position and the movements of the magician.</p>
