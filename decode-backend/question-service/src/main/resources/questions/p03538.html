<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Select any integer <var>N</var> between <var>1000</var> and <var>2000</var> (inclusive), and any integer <var>K</var> not less than <var>1</var>, then solve the problem below.</p>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>We have <var>N</var> sheets of paper.
Write <var>K</var> integers on each of them to satisfy the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each integer written must be between <var>1</var> and <var>N</var> (inclusive).</li>
<li>The <var>K</var> integers written on the same sheet must be all different.</li>
<li>Each of the integers between <var>1</var> and <var>N</var> must be written on exactly <var>K</var> sheets.</li>
<li>For any two sheet, there is exactly one integer that appears on both.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3><p>In the first line, print <var>N</var> and <var>K</var> separated by a space.</p>
<p>In the subsequent <var>N</var> lines, print your solution.
The <var>i</var>-th of these lines must contain the <var>K</var> integers written on the <var>i</var>-th sheet, with spaces in between.</p>

<h3>Sample Output</h3><pre>3 2
1 2
2 3
3 1
</pre>
<p>This is an example of a solution for <var>N = 3</var> and <var>K = 2</var>.</p>
<p>Note that this output will be judged as incorrect, since the constraint on <var>N</var> is not satisfied.</p></section>
