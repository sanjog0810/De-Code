<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>E869120's and square1001's <var>16</var>-th birthday is coming soon.<br/>
Takahashi from AtCoder Kingdom gave them a round cake cut into <var>16</var> equal fan-shaped pieces.</p>
<p>E869120 and square1001 were just about to eat <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> of those pieces, respectively,<br/>
when they found a note attached to the cake saying that "the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake".</p>
<p>Can both of them obey the instruction in the note and take desired numbers of pieces of cake?</p>
