<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>"Pizza At", a fast food chain, offers three kinds of pizza: "A-pizza", "B-pizza" and "AB-pizza". A-pizza and B-pizza are completely different pizzas, and AB-pizza is one half of A-pizza and one half of B-pizza combined together. The prices of one A-pizza, B-pizza and AB-pizza are <var>A</var> yen, <var>B</var> yen and <var>C</var> yen (yen is the currency of Japan), respectively.</p>
<p>Nakahashi needs to prepare <var>X</var> A-pizzas and <var>Y</var> B-pizzas for a party tonight. He can only obtain these pizzas by directly buying A-pizzas and B-pizzas, or buying two AB-pizzas and then rearrange them into one A-pizza and one B-pizza. At least how much money does he need for this? It is fine to have more pizzas than necessary by rearranging pizzas.</p>
