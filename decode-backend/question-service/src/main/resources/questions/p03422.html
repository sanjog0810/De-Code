<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi and Aoki are playing a stone-taking game. Initially, there are <var>N</var> piles of stones, and the <var>i</var>-th pile contains <var>A_i</var> stones and has an associated integer <var>K_i</var>.</p>
<p>Starting from Takahashi, Takahashi and Aoki take alternate turns to perform the following operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a pile. If the <var>i</var>-th pile is selected and there are <var>X</var> stones left in the pile, remove some number of stones between <var>1</var> and <var>floor(X/K_i)</var> (inclusive) from the pile.</li>
</ul>
<p>The player who first becomes unable to perform the operation loses the game. Assuming that both players play optimally, determine the winner of the game.
Here, <var>floor(x)</var> represents the largest integer not greater than <var>x</var>.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>Aoki
</pre>
<p>Initially, from the first pile at most <var>floor(5/2)=2</var> stones can be removed at a time, and from the second pile at most <var>floor(3/3)=1</var> stone can be removed at a time.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Takahashi first takes two stones from the first pile, from the first pile at most <var>floor(3/2)=1</var> stone can now be removed at a time, and from the second pile at most <var>floor(3/3)=1</var> stone can be removed at a time.</li>
<li>Then, if Aoki takes one stone from the second pile, from the first pile at most <var>floor(3/2)=1</var> stone can be removed at a time, and from the second pile no more stones can be removed (since <var>floor(2/3)=0</var>).</li>
<li>Then, if Takahashi takes one stone from the first pile, from the first pile at most <var>floor(2/2)=1</var> stone can now be removed at a time, and from the second pile no more stones can be removed.</li>
<li>Then, if Aoki takes one stone from the first pile, from the first pile at most <var>floor(1/2)=0</var> stones can now be removed at a time, and from the second pile no more stones can be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>No more operation can be performed, thus Aoki wins. If Takahashi plays differently, Aoki can also win by play accordingly.</p>
