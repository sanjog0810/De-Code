<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>There are <var>N</var> empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right.
The integer <var>i</var> is written on the <var>i</var>-th box from the left <var>(1 \leq i \leq N)</var>.</p>
<p>For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.</p>
<p>We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every integer <var>i</var> between <var>1</var> and <var>N</var> (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of <var>i</var> written on them is congruent to <var>a_i</var> modulo <var>2</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3><ul>
<li>All values in input are integers.</li>
<li><var>1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5</var></li>
<li><var>a_i</var> is <var>0</var> or <var>1</var>.</li>

<h3>Input</h3><p>Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:</p>

<h3>Output</h3><p>If a good set of choices does not exist, print <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:</p>
<pre><var>M</var>
<var>b_1</var> <var>b_2</var> <var>...</var> <var>b_M</var>
</pre>
<p>where <var>M</var> denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and <var>b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M</var> are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.</p>

<p>Consider putting a ball only in the box with <var>1</var> written on it.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are three boxes with multiples of <var>1</var> written on them: the boxes with <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, and <var>3</var>. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is <var>1</var>.</li>
<li>There is only one box with a multiple of <var>2</var> written on it: the box with <var>2</var>. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is <var>0</var>.</li>
<li>There is only one box with a multiple of <var>3</var> written on it: the box with <var>3</var>. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is <var>0</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the condition is satisfied, so this set of choices is good.</p>
