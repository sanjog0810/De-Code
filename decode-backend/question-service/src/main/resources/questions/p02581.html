<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>We have <var>3N</var> cards arranged in a row from left to right, where each card has an integer between <var>1</var> and <var>N</var> (inclusive) written on it. The integer written on the <var>i</var>-th card from the left is <var>A_i</var>.</p>
<p>You will do the following operation <var>N-1</var> times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rearrange the five leftmost cards in any order you like, then remove the three leftmost cards. If the integers written on those three cards are all equal, you gain <var>1</var> point.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these <var>N-1</var> operations, if the integers written on the remaining three cards are all equal, you will gain <var>1</var> additional point.</p>
<p>Find the maximum number of points you can gain.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>2
</pre>
<p>Let us rearrange the five leftmost cards so that the integers written on the six cards will be <var>2\ 2\ 2\ 1\ 1\ 1</var> from left to right.</p>
<p>Then, remove the three leftmost cards, all of which have the same integer <var>2</var>, gaining <var>1</var> point.</p>
<p>Now, the integers written on the remaining cards are <var>1\ 1\ 1</var>.</p>
<p>Since these three cards have the same integer <var>1</var>, we gain <var>1</var> more point.</p>
<p>In this way, we can gain <var>2</var> points - which is the maximum possible.</p>
