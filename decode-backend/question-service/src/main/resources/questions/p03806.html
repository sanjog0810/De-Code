<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Dolphin is planning to generate a small amount of a certain chemical substance C.<br/>
In order to generate the substance C, he must prepare a solution which is a mixture of two substances A and B in the ratio of <var>M_a:M_b</var>.<br/>
He does not have any stock of chemicals, however, so he will purchase some chemicals at a local pharmacy.<br/>
The pharmacy sells <var>N</var> kinds of chemicals. For each kind of chemical, there is exactly one package of that chemical in stock.<br/>
The package of chemical <var>i</var> contains <var>a_i</var> grams of the substance A and <var>b_i</var> grams of the substance B, and is sold for <var>c_i</var> yen (the currency of Japan).<br/>
Dolphin will purchase some of these packages. For some reason, he must use all contents of the purchased packages to generate the substance C.<br/>
Find the minimum amount of money required to generate the substance C.<br/>
If it is not possible to generate the substance C by purchasing any combination of packages at the pharmacy, report that fact.  </p>

<p>The amount of money spent will be minimized by purchasing the packages of chemicals <var>1</var> and <var>2</var>.<br/>
In this case, the mixture of the purchased chemicals will contain <var>3</var> grams of the substance A and <var>3</var> grams of the substance B, which are in the desired ratio: <var>3:3=1:1</var>.<br/>
The total price of these packages is <var>3</var> yen.  </p>
