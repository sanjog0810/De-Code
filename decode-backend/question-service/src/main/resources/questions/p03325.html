<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>As AtCoder Beginner Contest 100 is taking place, the office of AtCoder, Inc. is decorated with a sequence of length <var>N</var>, <var>a = </var>{<var>a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_N</var>}.<br/>
Snuke, an employee, would like to play with this sequence.</p>
<p>Specifically, he would like to repeat the following operation as many times as possible:</p>
<pre>For every <var>i</var> satisfying <var>1 \leq i \leq N</var>, perform one of the following: "divide <var>a_i</var> by <var>2</var>" and "multiply <var>a_i</var> by <var>3</var>".  
Here, choosing "multiply <var>a_i</var> by <var>3</var>" for every <var>i</var> is not allowed, and the value of <var>a_i</var> after the operation must be an integer.
</pre>
<p>At most how many operations can be performed?</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li><var>N</var> is an integer between <var>1</var> and <var>10 \ 000</var> (inclusive).</li>
<li><var>a_i</var> is an integer between <var>1</var> and <var>1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000</var> (inclusive).</li>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:</p>
<pre><var>N</var>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>3
</pre>
<p>The sequence is initially <var>{5, 2, 4}</var>. Three operations can be performed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, multiply <var>a_1</var> by <var>3</var>, multiply <var>a_2</var> by <var>3</var> and divide <var>a_3</var> by <var>2</var>. The sequence is now <var>{15, 6, 2}</var>.</li>
<li>Next, multiply <var>a_1</var> by <var>3</var>, divide <var>a_2</var> by <var>2</var> and multiply <var>a_3</var> by <var>3</var>. The sequence is now <var>{45, 3, 6}</var>.</li>
<li>Finally, multiply <var>a_1</var> by <var>3</var>, multiply <var>a_2</var> by <var>3</var> and divide <var>a_3</var> by <var>2</var>. The sequence is now <var>{135, 9, 3}</var>.</li>
