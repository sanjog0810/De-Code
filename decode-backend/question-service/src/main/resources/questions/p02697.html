<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>You are going to hold a competition of one-to-one game called AtCoder Janken. <em>(Janken is the Japanese name for Rock-paper-scissors.)</em>
<var>N</var> players will participate in this competition, and they are given distinct integers from <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>.
The arena has <var>M</var> playing fields for two players. You need to assign each playing field two distinct integers between <var>1</var> and <var>N</var> (inclusive).
You cannot assign the same integer to multiple playing fields.
The competition consists of <var>N</var> rounds, each of which proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each player, if there is a playing field that is assigned the player's integer, the player goes to that field and fight the other player who comes there.</li>
<li>Then, each player adds <var>1</var> to its integer. If it becomes <var>N+1</var>, change it to <var>1</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You want to ensure that no player fights the same opponent more than once during the <var>N</var> rounds.
Print an assignment of integers to the playing fields satisfying this condition.
It can be proved that such an assignment always exists under the constraints given.</p>

<p>Let us call the four players A, B, C, and D, and assume that they are initially given the integers <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, <var>3</var>, and <var>4</var>, respectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <var>1</var>-st round is fought by B and C, who has the integers <var>2</var> and <var>3</var>, respectively. After this round, A, B, C, and D have the integers <var>2</var>, <var>3</var>, <var>4</var>, and <var>1</var>, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <var>2</var>-nd round is fought by A and B, who has the integers <var>2</var> and <var>3</var>, respectively. After this round, A, B, C, and D have the integers <var>3</var>, <var>4</var>, <var>1</var>, and <var>2</var>, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <var>3</var>-rd round is fought by D and A, who has the integers <var>2</var> and <var>3</var>, respectively. After this round, A, B, C, and D have the integers <var>4</var>, <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, and <var>3</var>, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <var>4</var>-th round is fought by C and D, who has the integers <var>2</var> and <var>3</var>, respectively. After this round, A, B, C, and D have the integers <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, <var>3</var>, and <var>4</var>, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No player fights the same opponent more than once during the four rounds, so this solution will be accepted.</p>
