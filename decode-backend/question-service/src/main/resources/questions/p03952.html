<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>We have a pyramid with <var>N</var> steps, built with blocks.
The steps are numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var> from top to bottom.
For each <var>1≤i≤N</var>, step <var>i</var> consists of <var>2i-1</var> blocks aligned horizontally.
The pyramid is built so that the blocks at the centers of the steps are aligned vertically.</p>

<p>A pyramid with <var>N=4</var> steps</p>

<p>Snuke wrote a permutation of (<var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, <var>...</var>, <var>2N-1</var>) into the blocks of step <var>N</var>.
Then, he wrote integers into all remaining blocks, under the following rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>The integer written into a block <var>b</var> must be equal to the median of the three integers written into the three blocks directly under <var>b</var>, or to the lower left or lower right of <var>b</var>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing integers into the blocks</p>
</img></div>
<p>Afterwards, he erased all integers written into the blocks.
Now, he only remembers that the integer written into the block of step <var>1</var> was <var>x</var>.</p>
<p>Construct a permutation of (<var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, <var>...</var>, <var>2N-1</var>) that could have been written into the blocks of step <var>N</var>, or declare that Snuke's memory is incorrect and such a permutation does not exist.</p>

<h3>Output</h3><p>If no permutation of (<var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, <var>...</var>, <var>2N-1</var>) could have been written into the blocks of step <var>N</var>, print <code>No</code>.</p>
