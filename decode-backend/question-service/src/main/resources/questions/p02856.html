<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p><var>N</var> programmers are going to participate in the preliminary stage of DDCC 20XX. Due to the size of the venue, however, at most <var>9</var> contestants can participate in the finals.</p>
<p>The preliminary stage consists of several rounds, which will take place as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the <var>N</var> contestants will participate in the first round.</li>
<li>When <var>X</var> contestants participate in some round, the number of contestants advancing to the next round will be decided as follows:<ul>
<li>The organizer will choose two consecutive digits in the decimal notation of <var>X</var>, and replace them with the sum of these digits. The number resulted will be the number of contestants advancing to the next round.<br/>
For example, when <var>X = 2378</var>, the number of contestants advancing to the next round will be <var>578</var> (if <var>2</var> and <var>3</var> are chosen), <var>2108</var> (if <var>3</var> and <var>7</var> are chosen), or <var>2315</var> (if <var>7</var> and <var>8</var> are chosen).<br/>
When <var>X = 100</var>, the number of contestants advancing to the next round will be <var>10</var>, no matter which two digits are chosen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The preliminary stage ends when <var>9</var> or fewer contestants remain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ringo, the chief organizer, wants to hold as many rounds as possible.
Find the maximum possible number of rounds in the preliminary stage.</p>
<p>Since the number of contestants, <var>N</var>, can be enormous, it is given to you as two integer sequences <var>d_1, \ldots, d_M</var> and <var>c_1, \ldots, c_M</var>, which means the following: the decimal notation of <var>N</var> consists of <var>c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_M</var> digits, whose first <var>c_1</var> digits are all <var>d_1</var>, the following <var>c_2</var> digits are all <var>d_2</var>, <var>\ldots</var>, and the last <var>c_M</var> digits are all <var>d_M</var>.</p>

<p>In this case, <var>N = 229</var> contestants will participate in the first round. One possible progression of the preliminary stage is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><var>229</var> contestants participate in Round <var>1</var>, <var>49</var> contestants participate in Round <var>2</var>, <var>13</var> contestants participate in Round <var>3</var>, and <var>4</var> contestants advance to the finals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, three rounds take place in the preliminary stage, which is the maximum possible number.  </p>
