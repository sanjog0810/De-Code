<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>We have a tree with <var>N</var> vertices. The <var>i</var>-th edge connects Vertex <var>A_i</var> and <var>B_i</var> bidirectionally.</p>
<p>Takahashi is standing at Vertex <var>u</var>, and Aoki is standing at Vertex <var>v</var>.</p>
<p>Now, they will play a game of tag as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><var>1</var>. If Takahashi and Aoki are standing at the same vertex, the game ends. Otherwise, Takahashi moves to a vertex of his choice that is adjacent to his current vertex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><var>2</var>. If Takahashi and Aoki are standing at the same vertex, the game ends. Otherwise, Aoki moves to a vertex of his choice that is adjacent to his current vertex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><var>3</var>. Go back to step <var>1</var>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Takahashi performs his moves so that the game ends as late as possible, while Aoki performs his moves so that the game ends as early as possible.</p>
<p>Find the number of moves Aoki will perform before the end of the game if both Takahashi and Aoki know each other's position and strategy.</p>
<p>It can be proved that the game is bound to end.</p>

<p>If both players play optimally, the game will progress as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takahashi moves to Vertex <var>3</var>.</li>
<li>Aoki moves to Vertex <var>2</var>.</li>
<li>Takahashi moves to Vertex <var>5</var>.</li>
<li>Aoki moves to Vertex <var>3</var>.</li>
<li>Takahashi moves to Vertex <var>3</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, Aoki performs two moves.</p>
<p>Note that, in each move, it is prohibited to stay at the current vertex.</p>
