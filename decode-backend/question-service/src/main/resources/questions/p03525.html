<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>In CODE FESTIVAL XXXX, there are <var>N+1</var> participants from all over the world, including Takahashi.</p>
<p>Takahashi checked and found that the <em>time gap</em> (defined below) between the local times in his city and the <var>i</var>-th person's city was <var>D_i</var> hours.
The time gap between two cities is defined as follows. For two cities A and B, if the local time in city B is <var>d</var> o'clock at the moment when the local time in city A is <var>0</var> o'clock, then the time gap between these two cities is defined to be <var>min(d,24-d)</var> hours.
Here, we are using <var>24</var>-hour notation.
That is, the local time in the <var>i</var>-th person's city is either <var>d</var> o'clock or <var>24-d</var> o'clock at the moment when the local time in Takahashi's city is <var>0</var> o'clock, for example.</p>
<p>Then, for each pair of two people chosen from the <var>N+1</var> people, he wrote out the time gap between their cities. Let the smallest time gap among them be <var>s</var> hours.</p>
<p>Find the maximum possible value of <var>s</var>.</p>
