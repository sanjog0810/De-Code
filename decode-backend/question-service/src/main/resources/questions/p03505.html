<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p><em>ButCoder Inc.</em> runs a programming competition site called <em>ButCoder</em>. In this site, a user is given an integer value called rating that represents his/her skill, which changes each time he/she participates in a contest. The initial value of a new user's rating is <var>0</var>, and a user whose rating reaches <var>K</var> or higher is called <em>Kaiden</em> ("total transmission"). Note that a user's rating may become negative.</p>
<p>Hikuhashi is a new user in ButCoder. It is estimated that, his rating increases by <var>A</var> in each of his odd-numbered contests (first, third, fifth, ...), and decreases by <var>B</var> in each of his even-numbered contests (second, fourth, sixth, ...).</p>
<p>According to this estimate, after how many contests will he become Kaiden for the first time, or will he never become Kaiden?</p>
