<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
  There are some goats on a grid with <var>H</var> rows and <var>W</var> columns. 
  Alice wants to put some fences at some cells where goats do not exist so that no goat can get outside the grid. 
  Goats can move in the four directions, that is, up, down, right and left.
  Goats can not move onto the cells where fences are placed. 
  If a goat exists at one of the outermost cells in the grid, it can move outside.
  Goats do not move until all fences are placed.  
  Find the minimum number of fences to be placed.
