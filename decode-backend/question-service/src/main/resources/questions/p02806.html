<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Niwango created a playlist of <var>N</var> songs.
The title and the duration of the <var>i</var>-th song are <var>s_i</var> and <var>t_i</var> seconds, respectively.
It is guaranteed that <var>s_1,\ldots,s_N</var> are all distinct.</p>
<p>Niwango was doing some work while playing this playlist. (That is, all the songs were played once, in the order they appear in the playlist, without any pause in between.)
However, he fell asleep during his work, and he woke up after all the songs were played.
According to his record, it turned out that he fell asleep at the very end of the song titled <var>X</var>.</p>
<p>Find the duration of time when some song was played while Niwango was asleep.</p>
