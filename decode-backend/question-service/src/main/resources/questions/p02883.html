<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Takahashi will take part in an eating contest. Teams of <var>N</var> members will compete in this contest, and Takahashi's team consists of <var>N</var> players numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var> from youngest to oldest. The <em>consumption coefficient</em> of Member <var>i</var> is <var>A_i</var>.</p>
<p>In the contest, <var>N</var> foods numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var> will be presented, and the <em>difficulty</em> of Food <var>i</var> is <var>F_i</var>. The details of the contest are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A team should assign one member to each food, and should not assign the same member to multiple foods.</li>
<li>It will take <var>x \times y</var> seconds for a member to finish the food, where <var>x</var> is the consumption coefficient of the member and <var>y</var> is the difficulty of the dish.</li>
<li>The score of a team is the longest time it takes for an individual member to finish the food.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the contest, Takahashi's team decided to do some training. In one set of training, a member can reduce his/her consumption coefficient by <var>1</var>, as long as it does not go below <var>0</var>. However, for financial reasons, the <var>N</var> members can do at most <var>K</var> sets of training in total.</p>
<p>What is the minimum possible score of the team, achieved by choosing the amounts of members' training and allocating the dishes optimally?</p>

<p>They can achieve the score of <var>2</var>, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Member <var>1</var> does <var>4</var> sets of training and eats Food <var>2</var> in <var>(4-4) \times 3 = 0</var> seconds.</li>
<li>Member <var>2</var> does <var>1</var> set of training and eats Food <var>3</var> in <var>(2-1) \times 1 = 1</var> second.</li>
<li>Member <var>3</var> does <var>0</var> sets of training and eats Food <var>1</var> in <var>(1-0) \times 2 = 2</var> seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>They cannot achieve a score of less than <var>2</var>, so the answer is <var>2</var>.</p>
