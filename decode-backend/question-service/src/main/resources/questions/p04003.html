<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke's town has a subway system, consisting of <var>N</var> stations and <var>M</var> railway lines. The stations are numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>. Each line is operated by a company. Each company has an identification number.</p>
<p>The <var>i</var>-th ( <var>1 \leq i \leq M</var> ) line connects station <var>p_i</var> and <var>q_i</var> bidirectionally. There is no intermediate station. This line is operated by company <var>c_i</var>.</p>
<p>You can change trains at a station where multiple lines are available.</p>
<p>The fare system used in this subway system is a bit strange. When a passenger only uses lines that are operated by the same company, the fare is <var>1</var> yen (the currency of Japan). Whenever a passenger changes to a line that is operated by a different company from the current line, the passenger is charged an additional fare of <var>1</var> yen. In a case where a passenger who changed from some company A's line to another company's line changes to company A's line again, the additional fare is incurred again.</p>
<p>Snuke is now at station <var>1</var> and wants to travel to station <var>N</var> by subway. Find the minimum required fare.</p>
