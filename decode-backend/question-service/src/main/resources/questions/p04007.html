<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke and Ciel went to a strange stationery store. Each of them got a transparent graph paper with <var>H</var> rows and <var>W</var> columns.</p>
<p>Snuke painted some of the cells red in his paper. Here, the cells painted red were <em>4-connected</em>, that is, it was possible to traverse from any red cell to any other red cell, by moving to vertically or horizontally adjacent red cells only.</p>
<p>Ciel painted some of the cells blue in her paper. Here, the cells painted blue were 4-connected.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they precisely overlaid the two sheets in the same direction. Then, the intersection of the red cells and the blue cells appeared purple.</p>
<p>You are given a matrix of letters <var>a_{ij}</var> (<var>1≤i≤H</var>, <var>1≤j≤W</var>) that describes the positions of the purple cells. If the cell at the <var>i</var>-th row and <var>j</var>-th column is purple, then <var>a_{ij}</var> is <code>#</code>, otherwise <var>a_{ij}</var> is <code>.</code>. Here, it is guaranteed that <strong>no outermost cell is purple</strong>. That is, if <var>i=1, H</var> or <var>j = 1, W</var>, then <var>a_{ij}</var> is <code>.</code>.</p>
<p>Find a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation described. It can be shown that a solution always exists.</p>

<h3>Output</h3><p>Print a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first <var>H</var> lines should describe the positions of the red cells.</li>
<li>The following <var>1</var> line should be empty.</li>
<li>The following <var>H</var> lines should describe the positions of the blue cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>The description of the positions of the red or blue cells should follow the format of the description of the positions of the purple cells.</p>
