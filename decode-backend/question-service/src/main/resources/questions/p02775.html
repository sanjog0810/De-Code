<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>In the Kingdom of AtCoder, only banknotes are used as currency. There are <var>10^{100}+1</var> kinds of banknotes, with the values of <var>1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, \dots, 10^{(10^{100})}</var>. You have come shopping at a mall and are now buying a takoyaki machine with a value of <var>N</var>. <em>(Takoyaki is the name of a Japanese snack.)</em></p>
<p>To make the payment, you will choose some amount of money which is at least <var>N</var> and give it to the clerk. Then, the clerk gives you back the change, which is the amount of money you give minus <var>N</var>.</p>
<p>What will be the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk, when both choose the combination of banknotes to minimize this count?</p>
<p>Assume that you have sufficient numbers of banknotes, and so does the clerk.</p>
