<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>To become a millionaire, M-kun has decided to make money by trading in the next <var>N</var> days. Currently, he has <var>1000</var> yen and no stocks - only one kind of stock is issued in the country where he lives.</p>
<p>He is famous across the country for his ability to foresee the future. He already knows that the price of one stock in the next <var>N</var> days will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><var>A_1</var> yen on the <var>1</var>-st day, <var>A_2</var> yen on the <var>2</var>-nd day, ..., <var>A_N</var> yen on the <var>N</var>-th day.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <var>i</var>-th day, M-kun can make the following trade <strong>any number of times</strong> (possibly zero), <strong>within the amount of money and stocks that he has at the time</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy stock: Pay <var>A_i</var> yen and receive one stock.</li>
<li>Sell stock: Sell one stock for <var>A_i</var> yen.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the maximum possible amount of money that M-kun can have in the end by trading optimally?</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>1685

<p>In this sample input, M-kun has seven days of trading. One way to have <var>1685</var> yen in the end is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, he has <var>1000</var> yen and no stocks.</li>
<li>Day <var>1</var>: Buy <var>10</var> stocks for <var>1000</var> yen. Now he has <var>0</var> yen.</li>
<li>Day <var>2</var>: Sell <var>7</var> stocks for <var>910</var> yen. Now he has <var>910</var> yen.</li>
<li>Day <var>3</var>: Sell <var>3</var> stocks for <var>390</var> yen. Now he has <var>1300</var> yen.</li>
<li>Day <var>4</var>: Do nothing.</li>
<li>Day <var>5</var>: Buy <var>1</var> stock for <var>115</var> yen. Now he has <var>1185</var> yen.</li>
<li>Day <var>6</var>: Buy <var>10</var> stocks for <var>1150</var> yen. Now he has <var>35</var> yen.</li>
<li>Day <var>7</var>: Sell <var>11</var> stocks for <var>1650</var> yen. Now he has <var>1685</var> yen.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no way to have <var>1686</var> yen or more in the end, so the answer is <var>1685</var>.</p>
