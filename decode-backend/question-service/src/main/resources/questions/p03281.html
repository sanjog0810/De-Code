<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>The number <var>105</var> is quite special - it is odd but still it has eight divisors.
Now, your task is this: how many odd numbers with exactly eight positive divisors are there between <var>1</var> and <var>N</var> (inclusive)?</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>1

<p>Among the numbers between <var>1</var> and <var>105</var>, the only number that is odd and has exactly eight divisors is <var>105</var>.</p>

<p><var>1</var> has one divisor. <var>3</var>, <var>5</var> and <var>7</var> are all prime and have two divisors. Thus, there is no number that satisfies the condition.</p></section>
