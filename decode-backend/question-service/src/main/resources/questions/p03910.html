<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>The problem set at <em>CODE FESTIVAL 20XX Finals</em> consists of <var>N</var> problems.</p>
<p>The score allocated to the <var>i</var>-th <var>(1≦i≦N)</var> problem is <var>i</var> points.</p>
<p>Takahashi, a contestant, is trying to score exactly <var>N</var> points. For that, he is deciding which problems to solve.</p>
<p>As problems with higher scores are harder, he wants to minimize the highest score of a problem among the ones solved by him.</p>
<p>Determine the set of problems that should be solved.</p>

<h3>Output</h3><p>Among the sets of problems with the total score of <var>N</var>, find a set in which the highest score of a problem is minimum, then print the indices of the problems in the set in any order, one per line.</p>
<p>If there exists more than one such set, any of them will be accepted.</p>
