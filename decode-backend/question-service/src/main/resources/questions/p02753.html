<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>In AtCoder City, there are three stations numbered <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, and <var>3</var>.</p>
<p>Each of these stations is operated by one of the two railway companies, A and B. A string <var>S</var> of length <var>3</var> represents which company operates each station. If <var>S_i</var> is <code>A</code>, Company A operates Station <var>i</var>; if <var>S_i</var> is <code>B</code>, Company B operates Station <var>i</var>.</p>
<p>To improve the transportation condition, for each pair of a station operated by Company A and one operated by Company B, there will be a bus service connecting them.</p>
<p>Determine if there is a pair of stations that will be connected by a bus service.</p>
