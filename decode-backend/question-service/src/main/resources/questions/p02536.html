<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>There are <var>N</var> cities numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>, and <var>M</var> bidirectional roads numbered <var>1</var> through <var>M</var>.
Road <var>i</var> connects City <var>A_i</var> and City <var>B_i</var>.</p>
<p>Snuke can perform the following operation zero or more times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose two distinct cities that are not directly connected by a road, and build a new road between the two cities.</li>
</ul>
<p>After he finishes the operations, it must be possible to travel from any city to any other cities by following roads (possibly multiple times).</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of roads he must build to achieve the goal?</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>1
</pre>
<p>Initially, there are three cities, and there is a road between City <var>1</var> and City <var>2</var>.</p>
<p>Snuke can achieve the goal by building one new road, for example, between City <var>1</var> and City <var>3</var>.
After that,</p>
<ul>
<li>We can travel between <var>1</var> and <var>2</var> directly.</li>
<li>We can travel between <var>1</var> and <var>3</var> directly.</li>
<li>We can travel between <var>2</var> and <var>3</var> by following both roads (<var>2</var> - <var>1</var> - <var>3</var>).</li>
</ul></section>
