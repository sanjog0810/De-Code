<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi has a strong stomach. He never gets a stomachache from eating something whose "best-by" date is at most <var>X</var> days earlier.
He gets a stomachache if the "best-by" date of the food is <var>X+1</var> or more days earlier, though.</p>
<p>Other than that, he finds the food delicious if he eats it not later than the "best-by" date. Otherwise, he does not find it delicious.</p>
<p>Takahashi bought some food <var>A</var> days before the "best-by" date, and ate it <var>B</var> days after he bought it.</p>
<p>Write a program that outputs <code>delicious</code> if he found it delicious, <code>safe</code> if he did not found it delicious but did not get a stomachache either, and <code>dangerous</code> if he got a stomachache.</p>
