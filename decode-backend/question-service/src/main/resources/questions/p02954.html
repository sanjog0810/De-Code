<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Given is a string <var>S</var> consisting of <code>L</code> and <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>Let <var>N</var> be the length of <var>S</var>. There are <var>N</var> squares arranged from left to right, and the <var>i</var>-th character of <var>S</var> from the left is written on the <var>i</var>-th square from the left.</p>
<p>The character written on the leftmost square is always <code>R</code>, and the character written on the rightmost square is always <code>L</code>.</p>
<p>Initially, one child is standing on each square.</p>
<p>Each child will perform the move below <var>10^{100}</var> times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move one square in the direction specified by the character written in the square on which the child is standing. <code>L</code> denotes left, and <code>R</code> denotes right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find the number of children standing on each square after the children performed the moves.</p>
