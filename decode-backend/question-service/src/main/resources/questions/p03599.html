<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke is making sugar water in a beaker.
Initially, the beaker is empty. Snuke can perform the following four types of operations any number of times. He may choose not to perform some types of operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Operation 1: Pour <var>100A</var> grams of water into the beaker.</li>
<li>Operation 2: Pour <var>100B</var> grams of water into the beaker.</li>
<li>Operation 3: Put <var>C</var> grams of sugar into the beaker.</li>
<li>Operation 4: Put <var>D</var> grams of sugar into the beaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our experimental environment, <var>E</var> grams of sugar can dissolve into <var>100</var> grams of water.</p>
<p>Snuke will make sugar water with the highest possible density.</p>
<p>The beaker can contain at most <var>F</var> grams of substances (water and sugar combined), and there must not be any undissolved sugar in the beaker.
Find the mass of the sugar water Snuke will make, and the mass of sugar dissolved in it.
If there is more than one candidate, any of them will be accepted.</p>
<p>We remind you that the sugar water that contains <var>a</var> grams of water and <var>b</var> grams of sugar is <var>\frac{100b}{a + b}</var> percent.
Also, in this problem, pure water that does not contain any sugar is regarded as <var>0</var> percent density sugar water.</p>

<h3>Outputs</h3><p>Print two integers separated by a space.
The first integer should be the mass of the desired sugar water, and the second should be the mass of the sugar dissolved in it.</p>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>110 10
</pre>
<p>In this environment, <var>15</var> grams of sugar can dissolve into <var>100</var> grams of water, and the beaker can contain at most <var>200</var> grams of substances.</p>
<p>We can make <var>110</var> grams of sugar water by performing Operation 1 once and Operation 3 once.
It is not possible to make sugar water with higher density.
For example, the following sequences of operations are infeasible:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we perform Operation 1 once and Operation 4 once, there will be undissolved sugar in the beaker.</li>
<li>If we perform Operation 2 once and Operation 3 three times, the mass of substances in the beaker will exceed <var>200</var> grams.</li>

<h3>Sample Output 2</h3><pre>200 100

<p>There are other acceptable outputs, such as:</p>
<pre>400 200
</pre>
<p>However, the output below is not acceptable:</p>
<pre>300 150
</pre>
<p>This is because, in order to make <var>300</var> grams of sugar water containing <var>150</var> grams of sugar, we need to pour exactly <var>150</var> grams of water into the beaker, which is impossible.</p>
