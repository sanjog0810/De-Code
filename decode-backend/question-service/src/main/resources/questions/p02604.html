<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>New AtCoder City has an infinite grid of streets, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the center of the city stands a clock tower. Let <var>(0, 0)</var> be the coordinates of this point.</li>
<li>A straight street, which we will call <em>East-West Main Street</em>, runs east-west and passes the clock tower. It corresponds to the <var>x</var>-axis in the two-dimensional coordinate plane.</li>
<li>There are also other infinitely many streets parallel to East-West Main Street, with a distance of <var>1</var> between them. They correspond to the lines <var>\ldots, y = -2, y = -1, y = 1, y = 2, \ldots</var> in the two-dimensional coordinate plane.</li>
<li>A straight street, which we will call <em>North-South Main Street</em>, runs north-south and passes the clock tower. It corresponds to the <var>y</var>-axis in the two-dimensional coordinate plane.</li>
<li>There are also other infinitely many streets parallel to North-South Main Street, with a distance of <var>1</var> between them. They correspond to the lines <var>\ldots, x = -2, x = -1, x = 1, x = 2, \ldots</var> in the two-dimensional coordinate plane.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <var>N</var> residential areas in New AtCoder City. The <var>i</var>-th area is located at the intersection with the coordinates <var>(X_i, Y_i)</var> and has a population of <var>P_i</var>. Each citizen in the city lives in one of these areas.</p>
<p><strong>The city currently has only two railroads, stretching infinitely, one along East-West Main Street and the other along North-South Main Street.</strong><br/>
M-kun, the mayor, thinks that they are not enough for the commuters, so he decides to choose <var>K</var> streets and build a railroad stretching infinitely along each of those streets.</p>
<p>Let the <em>walking distance</em> of each citizen be the distance from his/her residential area to the nearest railroad.<br/>
M-kun wants to build railroads so that the sum of the walking distances of all citizens, <var>S</var>, is minimized.</p>
<p>For each <var>K = 0, 1, 2, \dots, N</var>, what is the minimum possible value of <var>S</var> after building railroads?</p>

<p>When <var>K = 0</var>, the residents of Area <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, and <var>3</var> have to walk the distances of <var>1</var>, <var>3</var>, and <var>1</var>, respectively, to reach a railroad.<br/>
Thus, the sum of the walking distances of all citizens, <var>S</var>, is <var>1 \times 300 + 3 \times 600 + 1 \times 800 = 2900</var>.</p>
<p>When <var>K = 1</var>, if we build a railroad along the street corresponding to the line <var>y = 4</var> in the coordinate plane, the walking distances of the citizens of Area <var>1</var>, <var>2</var>, and <var>3</var> become <var>1</var>, <var>1</var>, and <var>0</var>, respectively.<br/>
Then, <var>S = 1 \times 300 + 1 \times 600 + 0 \times 800 = 900</var>.<br/>
We have many other options for where we build the railroad, but none of them makes <var>S</var> less than <var>900</var>.</p>
<p>When <var>K = 2</var>, if we build a railroad along the street corresponding to the lines <var>x = 1</var> and <var>x = 3</var> in the coordinate plane, all citizens can reach a railroad with the walking distance of <var>0</var>, so <var>S = 0</var>. We can also have <var>S = 0</var> when <var>K = 3</var>.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the optimal way to build railroads for the cases <var>K = 0, 1, 2</var>.<br/>
The street painted blue represents the roads along which we build railroads.</p>
