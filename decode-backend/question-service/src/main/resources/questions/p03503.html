<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Joisino is planning to open a shop in a shopping street.</p>
<p>Each of the five weekdays is divided into two periods, the morning and the evening. For each of those ten periods, a shop must be either open during the whole period, or closed during the whole period. Naturally, a shop must be open during at least one of those periods.</p>
<p>There are already <var>N</var> stores in the street, numbered <var>1</var> through <var>N</var>.</p>
<p>You are given information of the business hours of those shops, <var>F_{i,j,k}</var>. If <var>F_{i,j,k}=1</var>, Shop <var>i</var> is open during Period <var>k</var> on Day <var>j</var> (this notation is explained below); if <var>F_{i,j,k}=0</var>, Shop <var>i</var> is closed during that period. Here, the days of the week are denoted as follows. Monday: Day <var>1</var>, Tuesday: Day <var>2</var>, Wednesday: Day <var>3</var>, Thursday: Day <var>4</var>, Friday: Day <var>5</var>. Also, the morning is denoted as Period <var>1</var>, and the afternoon is denoted as Period <var>2</var>.</p>
<p>Let <var>c_i</var> be the number of periods during which both Shop <var>i</var> and Joisino's shop are open. Then, the profit of Joisino's shop will be <var>P_{1,c_1}+P_{2,c_2}+...+P_{N,c_N}</var>.</p>
<p>Find the maximum possible profit of Joisino's shop when she decides whether her shop is open during each period, making sure that it is open during at least one period.</p>
