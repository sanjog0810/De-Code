<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi has a tower which is divided into <var>N</var> layers.
Initially, all the layers are uncolored. Takahashi is going to paint some of the layers in red, green or blue to make a beautiful tower.
He defines the <em>beauty of the tower</em> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The beauty of the tower is the sum of the scores of the <var>N</var> layers, where the score of a layer is <var>A</var> if the layer is painted red, <var>A+B</var> if the layer is painted green, <var>B</var> if the layer is painted blue, and <var>0</var> if the layer is uncolored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are positive integer constants given beforehand. Also note that a layer may not be painted in two or more colors.</p>
<p>Takahashi is planning to paint the tower so that the beauty of the tower becomes exactly <var>K</var>.
How many such ways are there to paint the tower? Find the count modulo <var>998244353</var>.
Two ways to paint the tower are considered different when there exists a layer that is painted in different colors, or a layer that is painted in some color in one of the ways and not in the other.</p>

<p>In this case, a red layer worth <var>1</var> points, a green layer worth <var>3</var> points and the blue layer worth <var>2</var> points. The beauty of the tower is <var>5</var> when we have one of the following sets of painted layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><var>1</var> green, <var>1</var> blue</li>
<li><var>1</var> red, <var>2</var> blues</li>
<li><var>2</var> reds, <var>1</var> green</li>
<li><var>3</var> reds, <var>1</var> blue</li>
