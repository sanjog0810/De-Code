<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke got an integer sequence of length <var>N</var> from his mother, as a birthday present. The <var>i</var>-th <var>(1 ≦ i ≦ N)</var> element of the sequence is <var>a_i</var>. The elements are pairwise distinct.
He is sorting this sequence in increasing order.
With supernatural power, he can perform the following two operations on the sequence in any order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operation <var>1</var>: choose <var>2</var> consecutive elements, then reverse the order of those elements.</li>
<li>Operation <var>2</var>: choose <var>3</var> consecutive elements, then reverse the order of those elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Snuke likes Operation <var>2</var>, but not Operation <var>1</var>. Find the minimum number of Operation <var>1</var> that he has to perform in order to sort the sequence in increasing order.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3><ul>
<li><var>1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5</var></li>
<li><var>0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9</var></li>
<li>If <var>i ≠ j</var>, then <var>A_i ≠ A_j</var>.</li>
<li>All input values are integers.</li>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3><pre>1

<p>The given sequence can be sorted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, reverse the order of the last three elements. The sequence is now: <var>2,1,3,4</var>.</li>
<li>Then, reverse the order of the first two elements. The sequence is now: <var>1,2,3,4</var>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sequence of operations, Operation <var>1</var> is performed once. It is not possible to sort the sequence with less number of Operation <var>1</var>, thus the answer is <var>1</var>.</p>
