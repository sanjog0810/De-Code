<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>We have weather records at AtCoder Town for some consecutive three days. A string of length <var>3</var>, <var>S</var>, represents the records - if the <var>i</var>-th character is <code>S</code>, it means it was sunny on the <var>i</var>-th day; if that character is <code>R</code>, it means it was rainy on that day.</p>
<p>Find the maximum number of consecutive rainy days in this period.</p>
