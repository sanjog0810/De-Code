<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of <em>Mysterious Light</em>.</p>
<p>Three mirrors of length <var>N</var> are set so that they form an equilateral triangle.
Let the vertices of the triangle be <var>a, b</var> and <var>c</var>.</p>
<p>Inside the triangle, the rifle is placed at the point <var>p</var> on segment <var>ab</var> such that <var>ap = X</var>.
(The size of the rifle is negligible.)
Now, the rifle is about to fire a ray of Mysterious Light in the direction of <var>bc</var>.</p>
<p>The ray of Mysterious Light will travel in a straight line, and will be reflected by mirrors, in the same ways as "ordinary" light.
There is one major difference, though: it will be also reflected by its own trajectory as if it is a mirror!
When the ray comes back to the rifle, the ray will be absorbed.</p>
<p>The following image shows the ray's trajectory where <var>N = 5</var> and <var>X = 2</var>.</p>

<p>It can be shown that the ray eventually comes back to the rifle and is absorbed, regardless of the values of <var>N</var> and <var>X</var>.
Find the total length of the ray's trajectory.</p>
