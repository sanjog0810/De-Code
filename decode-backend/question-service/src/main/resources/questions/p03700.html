<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>You are going out for a walk, when you suddenly encounter <var>N</var> monsters. Each monster has a parameter called <em>health</em>, and the health of the <var>i</var>-th monster is <var>h_i</var> at the moment of encounter. A monster will vanish immediately when its health drops to <var>0</var> or below.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you are a skilled magician, capable of causing explosions that damage monsters. In one explosion, you can damage monsters as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select an alive monster, and cause an explosion centered at that monster. The health of the monster at the center of the explosion will decrease by <var>A</var>, and the health of each of the other monsters will decrease by <var>B</var>. Here, <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are predetermined parameters, and <var>A &gt; B</var> holds.</li>
</ul>
<p>At least how many explosions do you need to cause in order to vanish all the monsters?</p>

<p>You can vanish all the monsters in two explosion, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, cause an explosion centered at the monster with <var>8</var> health. The healths of the four monsters become <var>3</var>, <var>4</var>, <var>1</var> and <var>-1</var>, respectively, and the last monster vanishes.</li>
<li>Second, cause an explosion centered at the monster with <var>4</var> health remaining. The healths of the three remaining monsters become <var>0</var>, <var>-1</var> and <var>-2</var>, respectively, and all the monsters are now vanished.</li>
