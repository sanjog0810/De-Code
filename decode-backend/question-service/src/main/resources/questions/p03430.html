<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Takahashi has decided to give a string to his mother.</p>
<p>The <em>value</em> of a string <var>T</var> is the length of the longest common subsequence of <var>T</var> and <var>T'</var>, where <var>T'</var> is the string obtained by reversing <var>T</var>.
That is, the value is the longest length of the following two strings that are equal: a subsequence of <var>T</var> (possibly non-contiguous), and a subsequence of <var>T'</var> (possibly non-contiguous).</p>
<p>Takahashi has a string <var>S</var>. He wants to give her mother a string of the highest possible value, so he would like to change at most <var>K</var> characters in <var>S</var> to any other characters in order to obtain a string of the highest possible value.
Find the highest possible value achievable.</p>

<p>Changing the first character to <code>c</code> results in <code>cbcabcabc</code>.
Let this tring be <var>T</var>, then one longest common subsequence of <var>T</var> and <var>T'</var> is <code>cbabcbc</code>, whose length is <var>7</var>.</p>
