<h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>Along a road running in an east-west direction, there are <var>A</var> shrines and <var>B</var> temples.
The <var>i</var>-th shrine from the west is located at a distance of <var>s_i</var> meters from the west end of the road, and the <var>i</var>-th temple from the west is located at a distance of <var>t_i</var> meters from the west end of the road.</p>
<p>Answer the following <var>Q</var> queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query <var>i</var> (<var>1 \leq i \leq Q</var>): If we start from a point at a distance of <var>x_i</var> meters from the west end of the road and freely travel along the road, what is the minimum distance that needs to be traveled in order to visit one shrine and one temple? (It is allowed to pass by more shrines and temples than required.)</li>

<p>There are two shrines and three temples. The shrines are located at distances of <var>100, 600</var> meters from the west end of the road, and the temples are located at distances of <var>400, 900, 1000</var> meters from the west end of the road.</p>
<ul>
<li>Query <var>1</var>: If we start from a point at a distance of <var>150</var> meters from the west end of the road, the optimal move is first to walk <var>50</var> meters west to visit a shrine, then to walk <var>300</var> meters east to visit a temple.</li>
<li>Query <var>2</var>: If we start from a point at a distance of <var>2000</var> meters from the west end of the road, the optimal move is first to walk <var>1000</var> meters west to visit a temple, then to walk <var>400</var> meters west to visit a shrine. We will pass by another temple on the way, but it is fine.</li>
<li>Query <var>3</var>: If we start from a point at a distance of <var>899</var> meters from the west end of the road, the optimal move is first to walk <var>1</var> meter east to visit a temple, then to walk <var>300</var> meters west to visit a shrine.</li>
<li>Query <var>4</var>: If we start from a point at a distance of <var>799</var> meters from the west end of the road, the optimal move is first to walk <var>199</var> meters west to visit a shrine, then to walk <var>200</var> meters west to visit a temple.</li>
